AI-Enhanced Communication: Use Azure OpenAI to generate personalized emails, job descriptions, and follow-ups, ensuring professional and targeted messaging.
Workflow Integration: Automate tasks like sending emails, posting jobs, and scheduling interviews via Azure Functions and Logic Apps.
Monitoring & Optimization: Implement logging, monitoring, and feedback mechanisms to ensure reliable operations and continuous improvement.
Scalability & Security: Scale to handle increasing volumes while maintaining robust data security and compliance with Azure Key Vault and Active Directory.
The solution aims to improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and enhance the effectiveness of BD and recruitment operations.
